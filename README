ADA - Analog data aquisition
Simple voltage reading with ATtiny25.

The purpose is simply to get some analog data send to your computer.
You ask ADA for the reading of one of three ADC channels, and it (she?) 
answers the two bytes (10 bit resolution) over a serial connection.

To make communication simple, there is a frontend script written in Python.
And to make it enjoyable, there’s a GUI which even plots the voltages 
(Qt, Qwt, Python – of course).
